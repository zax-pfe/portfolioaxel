        I’ve been involved in all stages of projects: gathering requirements,
        design, backend development (mostly in <strong>Python</strong>), UI
        creation, deploying web apps and APIs, and cloud integration on{" "}
        <strong>Azure</strong>
        with <strong>Docker</strong>. These experiences helped me build strong
        autonomy, rigor, and a real team spirit.
